            Hold up! Before you make that purchase, have you really thought
            about all the wild things you could do with that money? You could
            start a llama farm, take up hip-hop aerobics, or even fund your very
            own superhero training academy. Take a moment to unleash your
            imagination and think about the exciting alternatives. It's all
